Enough is enough, I have been procrastinating a lot post-rsoc. I need to get back to coding, now that corona virus is in picture, I decided its high time to start writing some code. I even have things to do now:

* Radare2: I need to solve some issues and work on some major stuff to improve myself.
* Bhumi: I have been in a discussion with volunteers and have decided to implement some major things. But Its still in requirements phase, so might take a while.


Other than this, I am planning on doing bug bounty, if all goes well, I might get into cyber sec. Fingers crossed.
